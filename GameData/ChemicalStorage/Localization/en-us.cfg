		#LOC_ChemicalStorage_ic-tank-250-cryo-heavy_description = While this tank's 2.5m form factor may not seem too impressive, its configurable capacity from 8,000 to 48,000 litres makes it a versatile choice for small to medium-scale chemical storage.\nThis heavy-duty variant is ideal for long-term cryogenic storage on orbit or the ground, but don't expect it to do well in the rocket equation. A small amount of power is required to prevent gradual leakage.
		#LOC_ChemicalStorage_ic-tank-250-cryo-light_description = While this tank's 2.5m form factor may not seem too impressive, its configurable capacity from 8,000 to 48,000 litres makes it a versatile choice for small to medium-scale chemical storage.\nThis lightweight variant is highly mass-optimised, making it well-suited for storing spacecraft propellant. Active cooling may incur a significant power cost depending on the chemical and volume.
